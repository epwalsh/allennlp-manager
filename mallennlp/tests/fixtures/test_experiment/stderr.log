/home/epwalsh/.virtualenvs/allennlp/src/allennlp/allennlp/data/token_indexers/token_characters_indexer.py:59: UserWarning: You are using the default value (0) of `min_padding_length`, which can cause some subtle bugs (more info see https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/issues/1954). Strongly recommend to set a value, usually the maximum size of the convolutional layer size when using CnnEncoder.
